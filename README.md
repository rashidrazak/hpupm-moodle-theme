# HPUPM Moodle Theme

This is a theme for Moodle based off Boost theme. Since this is a child theme, it requires Boost theme to be installed.
If you don't already have Boost theme installed, get it from Moodle plugins directory.

## Instruction

Since Moodle theme directory structure is heavily reliant to directory name, it is required to rename this directory to be named `hpupm`.

```bash
cd <moodle_root_directory>/theme
git clone https://github.com/rashidrazak/hpupm-moodle-theme.git
mv hpupm-moodle-themme hpupm
```

Or, you could just simply rename during clone as below:

```bash
dc <moodle_root_directory>/theme
git clone https://github.com/rashidrazak/hpupm-moodle-theme.git hpupm
```
